When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when working on a different computer, or when working with someone else's code from the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes someone else may be working on the code on GitHub. I wouldn't want to blindly pull that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: A clone of a repository remotely located between different GitHub accounts.
Clones: A clone of a repository between a computer and a remote GitHub repository, or 2 computers.
Branhes: A series of commits that stem from the main project.
Forks are goood for when you cannot make changes to someone's reporitory. 
Clones are good for collaboration and having your code in 2 locations (local and remote).
Branches are good for keeping new, possibly experimental changes seperate from the main project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you end up working offline, it will be easy to merge with the repository once online again.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I could collaborate using Google Drive, but that automatically saves files, so versioning wouldn't be an otion.
This would make things much harder. However, the lack of a need to learn commands would be easier.
