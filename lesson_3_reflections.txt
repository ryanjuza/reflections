When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when working on a different computer, or when working with someone else's code from the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes someone else may be working on the code on GitHub. I wouldn't want to blindly pull that.
